#PizzaTime!
JavaScript Objects Exercise for Epicodus, 01.29.2016

###By Gracie Lundell

##Description
This is a project assigned to utilize the ability to create objects using JavaScript. Tests were written using the Chai and Mocha frameworks to check the functionality of the objects implemented. The object created was the Pizza object (representing the pizza a customer could customize). The method created, Pizza.price, was used to create the logic to determine the pizza's price based on the size and number of toppings added.
The objectives to be met of this exercise were as listed below:
-Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
-Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
-Use your own formula to create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen.
